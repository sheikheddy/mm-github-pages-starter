Driven, Eager, and Friendly. Abdur Raheem is a computer science major at the American University of Sharjah. He's been programming since he was 12, been interested in AI since he was 14, contributed to books, worked on research papers, been invited to speak at conferences, and has won multiple international awards. He's graduating a semester early because he went a little crazy with taking extra courses. In his free time, he is often exploring, reading on his laptop, or trying to find new recipes to cook.
