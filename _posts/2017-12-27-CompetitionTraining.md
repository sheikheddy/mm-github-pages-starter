I did "Training for Programming Competitions" with Dr. Ghassan Qadah this semester. It wasn't a course, but it was one of the most valuable experiences I've had at AUS, and I'd recommend anyone interested in learning how to code (and especially CMP/COE majors) to strongly consider joining it next semester. 

We met on Wednesdays from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM. We were split into two groups -- one with those who had taken programming courses before, and another that assumed no prior experience. As a freshman, I was automatically put into the latter. We used the C++ programming language, but honestly 99% of it was the C part.

Here's how a typical session went: Dr. Ghassan introduced a concept or tool, and it felt like a conversation instead of a lecture. He put some syntax on the board and then provided some insight into what was actually going on and why we did it like that. If anyone interrupted with a way to do it differently, he'd smile widely and say "Yes, we could also do that!" and compare the two ways with pinpoint precision and brevity, and point out other approaches in a style that made them seem completely obvious and natural. Then he would give us a problem. We would try to do it. If we were stuck we could raise our hand and he'd come over, but even when he was working with an individual he still had this awareness of the wider group so he'd never get carried away. These problems were relatively easy (like reverse sorting an array with a tiny twist), but there were always these tricks and edge cases that meant that it was suitable for a wide range of skill levels. 

I think I was close to the bottom of an exceedingly talented set of students who were the cream of the crop. Chris,Youssef, Shaham, Mahmoud, Ibrahim, Wisam, everyone who stayed after that first day (no slight intended if I missed your name, blame my approaching senility) -- they all have incredibly bright futures ahead of them. 
Since it wasn't a course, it was super chill . No one could force you to attend and there weren't any penalties for missing periods -- you could even request the professor to personally tell you what happened last time, and he would do it immediately -- no excuse required! If you didn't wanna do that, you could ask the person next to you, who would appreciate the distraction and provide you with a summary of his/her own understanding like you were an equal.

Want to drop in in the middle of the class in the middle of the semester and ask a random question even though we've never seen you before? Come in, we're glad to have you! 

Want to bring a friend along?  The more, the merrier! 

Want to do something completely unrelated to the problem or assignment? Fantastic, if you need any help with implementing your idea or want to show off your cool MS paint stickman, we're always there for you.

Want to google stuff when you have no idea what anyone is talking about? Sure, and we'll even tell you what websites have really good explanations. 

Don't want to be bothered? Put your headphones in and just let us know not to look over your shoulder, problem solved. 

Do you hate the lab computers and insist on using your laptop with it's custom keybinds and Ubuntu operating system? Feel free, my friend, and assuming you're a student you should know that you can get a lot of that software for free anyway!

Decide to bring in a textbook one day for reference? Great idea, beginners especially really benefit from that sort of thing, it's so wonderful that you're learning more from outside, we love that curiosity. 

Can't program your way out of a paper bag? Nothing to be ashamed of, we all start somewhere -- here, let me show you, or if you insist on figuring it out yourself I can give you a hint to point you in the right direction.

Made something in your own time? You can send it to us via email and we'll give you helpful feedback, praise for its strengths, and suggestions on how you can make it even more powerful and efficient that derive from our decades of experience.

I have a little bit of random experience accumulated from here and there when it comes to programming, but it isn't anything impressive. When I was a little kid I messed around with "inspect element" for giggles. When I was about 13 I was drawing shapes using JavaScript, and I learned Python from Codecademy, which went all the way up to classes and file i/o, but that didn't really go anywhere. There was a competition I participated in, in Heriot-Watt, and I was the only one in my team who could do anything more than "Hello World" or "FizzBuzz". We didn't win. I was exposed to the basics of HTML, CSS, and turtle from ICT class. I went for the ATechx Hackathon and played with the free Arduino robotics kits they gave us, which was a lot of fun. I tried [and failed spectacularly] to make an app one summer, and I want to say I learned a lot but honestly I was in wayy over my head. My oldest brother made a Pong AI that he controlled with his FPGA and showed me how he'd done it, while I nodded my head and pretended to understand. I've used MATLAB in the past (Just to see if I could), but it was overkill for my purposes, so I spared myself the effort and just did it in an easier way later on instead. Seeing it written out like that makes it seem like more than it is, but trust me, I'm nothing special when it comes to coding -- except maybe that I love maths, so I appreciate the need for statistics, linear algebra, graph theory, etc.

(Note: I'm aware this sounds like a humblebrag. It isn't meant to be one, I'm being honest about reporting my skill level -- above average, but nowhere near proficient, and certainly not even close to someone competent who knows what they're actually doing. I'm only a freshman!) 

I'm still interested and so I read a lot about computers -- programming's only one part of it, after all. My major is Computer Engineering, and I chose it for a reason. This training is intensive, so it would really help if you spent some time getting better outside of it. I have a few resources that worked for me (Ben Eater's series on building an 8-bit computer, Crashcourse Computer Science, Welch Labs' series "Learning to see", 3B1B's ongoing series on neural networks, A C++ Slack Group I joined, my oldest brother's textbooks, Khanacademy's articles on "Algorithms" and "Information theory", Anything by Computerphile or Louis Rossman, engineer4free, jamie king, learnpythonthehardway [which introduced me to Atom, which is currently my preferred text editor], Pixar's animation tutorials, various helpful talks and articles I've encountered over the web, etc), but they might not work for you, so I encourage you to keep trying things until it clicks -- it is hard, but it's also rewarding. Learn syntax, solve problems, make things. Don't be afraid of failure! 

If you're interested, join us in the first week of next Spring. You don't even need to register for anything. I thrived in that environment. We covered most of the CMP 120 syllabus in the Fall, so you can imagine how effective it was combined with sites like learncpp. I think we'll be going deeper into data structures and algorithms going forwards. If you have the stamina and discipline to keep up (intelligence is a plus, but tbh not as big of a factor as people think it is), then you'll feel right at home.
