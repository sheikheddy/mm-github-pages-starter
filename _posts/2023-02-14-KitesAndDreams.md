Every strength, reversed, a weakness. This is the last era in which such expression could be meaningful. Before it is lost as art and becomes commodity.

So hate it, if you will. Hate his immersion. His complete commitment to silence that isolated his thoughts from grounding in sanity. He ignored the fleeting distractions of his environment and cut off the connection to everything held precious so that he could be alone with craft as his sole companion.

And he was a traitor to his work and his duty and his family. So do not admire him. Enslaved to passion. Cultist to compulsion. Acolyte to addiction.

But do not tell me his devotion was sin. For he loved so intensely that his soul shone past the gaps in his wounds. Or do you think there can be creation without destruction? Attention without neglect? 

His mastery so narrow that he was crippled, his understanding so deep that he was lost, no balance to it, no greyness, all color, a great price was paid, but see the fruits of sacrifice, of labor, of practice!

Was it worth it? What is worth? The dollar in the miser's pocket? The jewel in the emperor's crown? The lightness of spontaneous encounters and joy of empty calendars on a sunrise spring morning? Whatever is held dearly, and is cherished, and nurtured, and protected, and sacred, that is worth.

If he could have kept all of it, he would have, health, relationships, success, and all the avarice of mankind. Alas, mortality! Alas, scarcity! Alas, humanity! Who could blame him if he had let go of the kite he was flying. All dreams lie beyond the reach of the sensible. Nay, I refuse to decry them, a normal life is a fortune.

It was not thrown away in a moment. It was the gradually increasing pull of the string, threatening to sweep you out to sea, and you held your ground, steadfast, but someone cruel had bound the thread to his heart, so would he let go, and cease to live? Thus he drowned, to survive.

Was it ever a choice? Was this nature, playing out, predetermined, inevitable? Perhaps so, but I do not see it that way, it was agency, not destiny, and every day he questioned whether his path was worthy, all those who ate fruit but did not care to garden smiled, crinkled their nose in polite disgust, and told him such foolish motives were only appropriate for fantasies and hackathons. Where there is no risk and no skin in the game, no novelty nor innovation, even blind lepers saw clearly: approval so obviously faked. And certainty that kites always come crashing down.

"Don't spend too much time on it", they advise, "I won't spend too much time on it", I lie, because you are old and wrong and don't know what you're talking about, and I am aware I shall never be able to convince you even with overwhelming evidence, so it's easier to go behind your back and do it my way since you'll never notice anyway, and I am not arrogant enough to be sure that this is right, but I do have some hubris in me, the conviction required to make a decision and stick to it, to bet that in time you will come to see the same truth I now behold.

That you do not see it now is a product of your information diet, where sycopanths and yes-men compete for your favor, stroking your ego, the weight of your power and experience reassuring you, noise, noise, warped perceptions of reality, the king throws a feast, the nobles count the grains, and the peasants touch the soil, whose word on drought remains?
