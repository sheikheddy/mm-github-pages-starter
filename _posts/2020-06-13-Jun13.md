This is the first in a series of writing experiments that I'll be sharing with you. 
Why am I hosting these on my website instead of just sending over a pdf file? 
Well, I put so much effort into creating it, but I ended up never using it. Half a year has gone by without me posting anything new. 
And that's not because I've stopped writing — it's because I haven't been brave enough to publish anything online.

I have this idea that my blog should serve as a place where I can demonstrate my technical skills, so writing random thoughts there would go against the spirit of that. At the same time, I have random thoughts that I write down, but I don't necessarily want to publicize them.
I don't need them to be secret — just not front and center whenever you visit. I know that this resistance is irrational, but it's powerful, and it's prevented me from posting for a long period of time. So there's this workaround where you can only access this post if you have the link, and I think that that's good enough for my privacy.

This doesn't constitute a return to social media, but I hope it will help me become more comfortable with posting here again.
