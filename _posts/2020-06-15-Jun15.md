My mom made some pancakes, but they were so burnt that we jokingly called them toast. 

My sister had mobilized my cousins to make them, so the batter and the first batch was fine, 
but when my mom invaded in the second round she had a 'scorched earth' policy. haha. 

At least the layer of nutella covered up the charred taste.

I've been more active on twitter recently. I don't mean to say I've been tweeting, just that I've been wasting time lurking.

I made the mistake of treating twitter like fb early on, which made it hard for me to get into, since I was mostly adding people I knew irl.

It became much more valuable to me when I added people who I admire and look up to, public figures and those who are into the same stuff I am.

In honor of that, let me write the outline of three mini-ideas I've had bouncing around my head that I don't have the time to develop into full fledged essays.

## Virtualization 

does this prove too much?
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Skill is sometimes confused for intelligence. That&#39;s a category error. Intelligence is the ability to efficiently turn the resources at your disposal into new skills at arbitrary tasks. Intelligence is a conversion ratio between information (priors and experience) and skills.</p>&mdash; Fran√ßois Chollet (@fchollet) <a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1271964134288965633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
## Mobile Apps

but is it biology?
