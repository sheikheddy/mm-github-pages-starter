Welcome to my new blog! While you're here, make sure to check out [my CV](/cv.pdf). 

I've been meaning to make a personal website for quite some time, but I always overcomplicated it and got nowhere. This attempt was finally successful mostly because:

1. It's a static site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Doesn't get much simpler than this (Except maybe if you use [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com)).
2. I was procrastinating on something more important (the most powerful force known to man).

What I learned is that I really shouldn't try to reinvent the wheel. I'm not a front end engineer, so [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) belong to 'experimentation' more than 'production'. I can always add my own customizations if I want something more personalized, and this way it doesn't take days of planning and debugging just to get to a skeleton that _kinda_ looks right. 

Of course, if I was an expert, it would be a different story. This page would be a canvas to show off my visual creativity, and I'd get the instant emotional reaction I want to invoke. For that dream, I sacrificed dozens of hours on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn), checked out books on [Progressive Web Applications](https://amzn.to/2ohE6OT), and sold my soul to NPM. Parallax, particle animation, provoked life with the hover of a cursor; falling away subtly when one simply scrolls further.

Compared to those grand aspirations, this does seem a little underwhelming. But I like it. It's minimalistic. And a big improvement on the other tries that will never see the light of day. I still want my website to be special, because it's an artist's reflection in their medium. Yet I'm at peace with taking it one step at a time, improvement over improvement, rather than endlessly tinkering with something I'll never release. 

Was all of that a waste? Is there any good reason to use HTML and CSS to design the look & feel from scratch when so many excellent templates already exist? Well, it did help me learn the fundamentals, so I'm comfortable with the foundation upon which these abstractions are built. The basics are the most important of all: they keep things stable.

Enough navel gazing, then. I have so much good content to share with you. My life, my love, my learning. Solace in passionate curiosity. I sincerely wish that your life is improved in some way by the time we spend here. That has been, is, and shall remain the clear and foremost purpose of my writing. Take a look around, settle down, and keep reading!
