Keep in mind the difference between latency and availability. It's true that many people assume that a system that responds quickly is also always available.

There are two threads here that I want to untangle:

1. Fair consideration is when two parties agree mutually on an exchange, often described in a contract. In most social interactions, this is implicitly negotiated, and I agree with you that setting an expectation or norm of rapid responses would detract from comfort, focus, peace, and the quality of conversation.
2. Self-improvement is the process of consciously and intentionally taking steps to enhance one's knowledge, skills, and personal qualities in order to achieve growth, fulfillment, and a better life overall. My earlier dissatisfaction originated from a general desire to be able to process messages quickly, accurately, reliably, and at low cost.

I think if I had reduced response times without saying anything, it wouldn't have a noticeable impact on your experience talking to me, but since I did say something, "no pressure" is a signal to not place undue burden on myself to provide something that isn't even all that valuable in the first place.

And I appreciate that! But my model of undue burden is slightly different. When something comes in, and I take care of it quickly, it releases a valve of pressure in my mind. Taking a few seconds to tap out something simple, e.g "busy rn, talk later?" helps me avoid overthinking.

> You heal like someone pouring a cup over a fire, no matter how big or small. It isn’t your fault that you didn’t know. Healing is an art. It is not a paste or a potion to pour. It is a balm to apply perfectly. You wield the razor of life.

The weakness I want to overcome is precisely regulating/controlling/scaling how much I give something in proportion to how much is necessary to meet its needs. There's a line from 0 to 100, and a point in between, and I am wasteful in my spending, not leaving enough margin for the demands of what is truly important.

This chain of messages is evidence of that wastefulness, I suppose, where I hold a pen in place and ink drips all over the page, clouding a point that could have been made in one stroke.

It's a balancing art. Inhibit, allow, pull back, push forth. When I follow the path of least resistance, I don't put pressure on myself to slow down and apply the brakes, so the text takes a winding path around the garden instead of that direct and crisp route.

There's a reason I have chosen to continue to act this way even though it is wasteful. Because I would rather have the leisure of acting as if time was abundant, even if it is scarce, because it gives me the freedom to do as I wish, as long as I stay within budget, instead of micromanaging every minute to min-max return on investment. It is truly exhausting to stop before you're finished, so I am generous when indulging in activities that I enjoy, like writing, because life is too short to squeeze the life out of every moment with pointless guilt over opportunity cost.
