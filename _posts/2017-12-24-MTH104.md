I took MTH 104 (Calculus II) with professor Ghada Al Obaidi this semester. I liked her quizzes (we had 10 of them), explanations, attitude, and policies (except that she was a little inconsistent with lateness), but I think performance in math courses depends more on how much you practice than the professor you have. It was my favorite course, recitations were boring.
Here's a link to the textbook: https://drive.google.com/.../1lq3KDSWRmn02UJ6.../view...
This textbook is also used in other courses, so hold on to it. If you're coming from Calc 1 rest easy, 2 is much easier.
Here's a few resources:
http://mlessons.teachable.com/.../calcul.../lectures/1689461 -- These are real past AUS midterms and exams. Do them under timed conditions and meet with your professor during office hours to get feedback on how to improve.
http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/CalcII.aspx -- These are notes you can use to learn or refresh your memory on certain topics.
https://www.madasmaths.com/ -- Challenging questions more difficult than what you normally have.
https://ocw.mit.edu/.../18-01sc-single-variable-calculus.../ -- The problem sets are pretty good, lectures are decent but too long.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-series -- Obligatory khanacademy plug
https://betterexplained.com/ -- Intuitive explanations for a lot of concepts. Articles & videos. Made me see a few things I "already knew" in a different light.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM... -- Watch this for high quality animations and visually intuitive explanations. Or don't, I'm not your boss, it's your choice. I just think you should because it's really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9eCT6f_Ftw... -- Professor Leonard is a buff guy who carries you through the entire course.
https://brilliant.org/courses/#math -- Puzzle solving website with questions that really test your understanding.
http://www.dummies.com/.../calculus-ii-for-dummies-cheat.../ -- Useful cheat sheet for printing.
http://mediasite.mms.rpi.edu/Media.../Catalog/catalogs/calc2 -- Worked solutions to certain problems.
Practice a lot and get faster and better. There's no need to think too much about quiz or exam structure, just come on time, take neat notes, solve problems, go to office hours to make sure your solutions would get marks, and ask others for help when you get stuck.
