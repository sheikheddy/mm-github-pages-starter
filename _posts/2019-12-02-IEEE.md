# Invitation

A call came from Dr. Fadi at 4:04 PM on October 21, 2019 to congratulate me on winning the AI Challenge. He said that Dr. Bushra from Dubai Electronic Security Center would like to invite my team to present at an event on November 14. I replied that I’d be happy to go, and while he was on the line I got him to agree to write a recommendation letter for a scholarship I was applying to.

At 4:18 I went back inside my database systems lab. At 5:00 I had a meeting with Dr. Ra’fat to discuss the ministry of health project. At 6:17 I rode to the bus and started grading the homeworks I’d gotten from Dr. Hana during our meeting from 3:00 to 3:59. I had a midterm on the 23rd. Two quizzes on the 24th. A homework due on the 26th. Typical university student workload. 

I got an email from DESC with some guidelines for the presentation:

I sent an email to my professors asking to be excused from class on the day of the conference:

> Dear Professors,

> I hope you're doing well!

> I'm pleased to inform you that I've been invited by Dr. Bushra AlBelooshi (Head of Research and Innovation at the Dubai Electronic Security Center (DESC)) to speak at the IEEE UAE Cyber Intelligence Summit 2019. This year's theme is 'AI and the future of Cybersecurity'. You can see a list of speakers from last year here; all of whom have more years of experience in cybersecurity than I've had years alive (with the exception of Dr. Almulla who just received her PhD in 2017, and Mr. Ivanovsky, who only has a little more than 10 years of experience in IT security). It will be an honor to represent AUS at this prestigious event.

> The summit will probably be from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, so it's unlikely I'll be able to attend any midterms or classes before 3:00. I might be able to skip half the event and attend at least one class if my slot is near the beginning or end, but that'd be a waste of an opportunity to connect with cybersecurity professionals from academia, government, consultancy companies, and the private sector.

> In particular, DESC is offering a winter internship this year, and they're looking for students with some background in AI and Machine Learning (which is my specialization). Networking here would help me secure this opportunity. Having 3-4 internships on my resume goes a long way towards making me employable, and speaking experience at conferences makes me a more competitive applicant for grad school. So there exists some long term benefit to this decision.

> I know I shouldn't neglect my academics for extracurriculars, and that is not my intention. I'm almost caught up on the content I missed from the AI Challenge, and this might push me back again. I'll work hard to balance my passion for AI with my duty to keep up with coursework, and assure you that I'll study diligently to cover for lost time and material and to achieve a standard of consistent excellence. Thank you for your support last time, and I hope you are able to excuse me once again.

> Regards,
> Abdul Raheem

It took an embarrassingly long time to cobble together a bio, abstract, and photo. But we finished it and it went up on the website [https://ieee.ae/en/cybersecurity/](https://ieee.ae/en/cybersecurity/) besides people 10x more qualified than me. 

It took even longer to make the presentation. Remember how the DESC email said that the template was “attached below”? There was no attachment. After exchanging a few emails, they said we could use whatever template we liked and they would convert it. Eventually we did receive the template, and went through a long painful process to make our presentation. I’ll skip over the details, but basically: I made an outline, youssef added some parts, qurat made a draft (helping out even though she couldn’t attend), I overhauled it, youssef finalized it, and we submitted late.  

# Slides and Demo

The most challenging part was recording a demo. It was a little last minute, since I thought I wouldn’t have the time, but Dr. Bushra convinced me it was worthwhile.

> Hi,

> After fixing an obscure bug which caused the AI to not run properly when the screen was being recorded, changing the settings of my recording software after an error caused the video to be corrupted (and working around an error in my editing software when rendering), and an absurd number of reshoots, I've finally finished the demo. It's not highly polished, but it highlights the code for the AI and functionality preserving operations, and also shows virustotal reports for ransomware before and after modifications.

> Here’s a mega link for downloading and a youtube link for embedding.

> Regards,

The less said about that fiasco, the better. Apparently if you abuse Kazam enough, it can – out of pure spite –  make a 1 minute video take up gigabytes of space. Also, if you don’t cast the proper spells / make the appropriate human sacrifices then Kdenlive’s output will be a black screen instead of your lovingly crafted film. I somehow figured everything out but I can’t say it was fun…

Thankfully the final product was decent. Turn subtitles on when you’re watching:

That video lasted 1 minute. It was slide 9 of a 15 slide presentation, available here:

Take some time to flip through the slides. If you spend 4 seconds on each, that’s 1 minute in total. It’s a bargain compared to how much time we spent grappling with this in the library. Not to mention the time it took to rehearse for the big day. I asked a few friends if they could use my free ticket, but everyone had classes, so they couldn’t make it to the conference. It was slated to start at 8:00, so I had to sleep early the night before.

# Speaking at the conference

I arrived at around 8:30, missing the welcoming note. I’d been to Emirates towers before for the Arab Youth Startup Marketplace, although this was my first time visiting the GoDolphin Ballroom. Our lanyards were laid out on a table, and they gave me mine right away since they were expecting me. I didn’t need to register. It was modestly but comfortably sized, the lights were dimmed, and the chairs were comfy. I found a seat next to Youssef. Throughout the conference whenever someone said something that was going over my head in the security part, I’d text him and get a clarification. And I’d do the same for him whenever a presenter was getting technical about AI.

There was a short break in the middle where Youssef and I did our final rehearsals. I went back to the crew to check that everything was ready for our presentation, because from experience I know issues crop up at the worst time and it’s best to have constant vigilance. It turns out there was a video playback issue with our demo, but we were able to resolve it. Glad we caught it before I came on stage! My anticipation climbed until they clipped our mics to our shirts, and then it was game time.

It went smoothly (just like the simulations) and I like the way we handled being co-presenters. I would speak for a few slides, then Youssef would, then me, then Youssef. Seamless transitions we’d cued in advance, playing to our strengths. Big round of applause, question/answer session, more applause, award ceremony, networking lunch. A few people came up to us after our talk, and we had a good time chatting informally. I should really print some business cards!

Youssef and I took the metro back. He was going back to uni since he had a midterm at 5:00, but I was headed home since all my classes were over. We talked along the way. It was a nice break, but now I had to get back to my work! Showing off what you’ve done is alright, but what I really look forward to the doing, not the showing. That can get in the way of writing articles for this blog, but I’d rather do 50 things and select the best 5 so it doesn’t get boring. 

Anyway, it’s time I get back to preparing for my finals. Thanks for taking the time to read this post, and don’t forget to keep creating!
