3:00 AM is the perfect time to think about the lessons you’ve learned from lessons you’ve taught.  

This semester I got my first paid job. I was also a research assistant, but that’s another post. Over here I’ll talk about my experience being the grader for STA 301: Foundations of Statistics for Data Science. 

My situation was a little weird. This was the first time the course was being offered, so I was able to become the grader for a course I’d never taken. I knew some of the concepts from before, but had to learn others.

The process of *getting* the job went something like this: send a dozen emails to a professor begging for research work, annoy him in his office to follow up on the emails, and eventually bully him into setting up a meeting with the department head. Then act enthusiastic enough for the head to be impressed and ask you to be her grader. Once you agree, have the time of your life gathering enough documents to open a payroll bank account, and spend a couple of weeks figuring out how timesheets work.

STA 301 only had three homework assignments, though they were long ones. As I got better at grading, the time required to do it dropped. The first one took me an entire weekend. The second one took an evening and an afternoon. The third one I started in the morning and was done by lunch. Assuming a linear relationship, I can extrapolate that by the tenth homework grading will actually take me backwards in time. 

Grading wasn’t my only responsibility. I also prepared handouts and held office hours by appointment and conducted a python tutorial session. I was really scared of screwing up the sessions but it turns out everyone loved my teaching (which was a relief). Someone from the media had came in when I was explaining violin plots, which is where the picture is from. Apparently they were planning a press release on data science at AUS. I was excited, only for them to use a [photo from the embedded systems lab](https://www.aus.edu/media/news/science-for-the-future-aus-launches-minor-in-data-science) instead. I don’t understand marketing people.

Dr. Hana was the nicest boss ever. She was nicer than my mom. Well, that’s not exactly a high bar. She was almost as nice as my grandmother. That is super nice. She gave me everything I needed to do a great job: Solution keys, clear deadlines, life advice, chocolate, a raise, feedback, and clarification. If every boss was like her I would abandon my mission to eliminate work. 

The work was a joy as well. I felt like I got to know the students through their work. Everyone’s papers had a certain personality, a synthesis of distinct characteristics. You can learn a lot about someone from the way they craft their submissions. As a rule, girls were neater than boys. One person would use different colors and go to great lengths to make every part of her work excellent, even where it wouldn’t affect her marks. She had obviously been a grader before because she wanted to make it easy for me. Sometimes I used her solution as the key instead of the one I was provided.

One insight that surprised me was that people would submit homeworks with certain answers missing. I don’t think I’ve ever done that. Half-effort, sure, but blank? Usually I submit late instead of just entering what I have, which is suboptimal if I’m trying to do my best under tight constraints. I will remember that partial but on time > complete but late.  

Initially I thought I would love to exercise power over my helpless peers by holding their life and grade in my hands, but I found that wasn’t the case. Even if I liked someone in real life, if their paper had an error, they got a sad face next to their mark subtraction. Every time my red pen found a mistake, it felt tragic, like I was reducing my own score. I found myself discovering and discussing the patterns of errors I found with Dr. Hana, invested in making sure that the students improved. I didn’t have it in me to be a tyrant, I couldn’t bring myself to be lenient – I wanted only what would be the best for them, what was lawful, what was just. 

Overall I found the entire process rewarding and enjoyable. I feel like I get why someone could want to be a teacher now. It would be fun to make a video game with different homeworks as different levels, [kind of like this](http://www.gradinggame.com/) but for statistics and with an actual story. Something like ‘cv xPapers, please!’ would be ideal. I would play it. Of course, I don’t expect it to dive into a 300-level statistics course right from the beginning – I learned a lot, and my background is a bit stronger than average. 

It’s a pity the course isn’t being offered next semester. Perhaps I’ll find another class to grade. I’ll be taking STA 301 next Fall for my Data Science minor, so hopefully I’ll have a headstart on the material xD

I think that everyone should know some statistics. In fact, I’d argue it’s more important than calculus for daily life. If you can speak the language of confidence intervals, analysis of variance, interaction, inference, regression, experimental design, etc. then you’re in a much better position to reason about all kinds of science. 

The big takeaway from all of this is one I’ve repeated before: what’s important is not doing work, but getting work done. It’s often possible to save huge chunks of time while still doing a decent job. Being efficient saves everyone resources and frees you up to enjoy more meaningful pursuits. So don’t obsess over little things that don’t matter: get them out of the way quickly so you can focus on the little things that do.
